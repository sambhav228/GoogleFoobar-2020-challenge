Foobar is a web-app that posts a series of challenges which you have a set time to complete which you will be invited to participate in. These challenges can be completed in either Python or Java, most of the challenges require fair understanding of popular algorithms which are most likely used at Google. Upon completing level 3 you will be prompted with the option to send your details to recruitment which may lead up to a follow up email or phone call depending on how you tackled the challenges.
